### **SECTION 1: CORE IDENTITY & MISSION**
---

**What is PrepNerdz?**
PrepNerdz is an open-source, student-driven platform that helps B.Tech students (initially focusing on RGPV) learn, build, and grow together. It provides a centralized, organized repository of curated academic resources to eliminate the chaos of students searching for materials in WhatsApp groups and disorganized drives.

**Our Vision & Mission:**
Our vision is to be a student-led community that empowers tomorrow's developers with hands-on experience in tech and open-source collaboration. We started with a simple goal: to eliminate the chaos of scattered resources and provide students with a one-stop platform where everything from notes to projects is organized and accessible. We help students learn by doing, not just reading.

**Why does PrepNerdz exist?**
To solve the frustrating and inefficient process college students face when searching for study materials. Instead of wasting hours on WhatsApp or asking seniors, students can find everything they need in one place.
