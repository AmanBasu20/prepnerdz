## üöÄ Getting Started: Your First Contribution

Ready to write some code? Follow these steps carefully to set up your local development environment.

### Step 1: System Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: v18.x or higher is recommended.
- **npm** or **yarn**: The project uses npm by default.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **PostgreSQL**: A local or cloud-based ([NEON](https://neon.tech)) PostgreSQL database (v15+ recommended).

### Step 2: Fork & Clone the Repository

1.  **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the top-right of the [Prepnerdz GitHub page](https://github.com/Shubhashish-Chakraborty/prepnerdz). This creates a copy of the project under your own GitHub account.

2.  **Clone your fork**: On your local machine, run the following command, replacing `your-github-username` with your actual username.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/prepnerdz.git
    cd prepnerdz
    ```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch

**This is a mandatory step.** All contributions must be made on a separate branch, not on `main`. Pull requests made from the `main` branch will be closed.

Create a new branch with a descriptive name.

- For features: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name` (e.g., `feat/add-dark-mode`)
- For bug fixes: `git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix` (e.g., `fix/login-button-bug`)

```bash
# Example:
git checkout -b feat/add-resource-search-bar
```

### Step 4: Set Up the Local Environment

1.  **Install Dependencies**: From the root directory of the project, install all the necessary packages.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables (`.env`)**: You need to create a `.env` file for each application (`web`, `backend`, `admin`). Sample files are provided.

    - Navigate to each app's directory and copy the `.env.sample` file to a new `.env` file.
    - **For the backend (`apps/backend`):**
      ```bash
      cd apps/backend
      cp .env.sample .env
      ```
    - **Open `apps/backend/.env`** and fill in the required values, especially your `DATABASE_URL`.

    Repeat this process for `apps/web` and `apps/admin`.

3.  **Run the Project**: Start all applications in development mode. Run this command from the **root directory**.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command uses Turborepo to start the frontend, backend, and admin panel simultaneously. You're now ready to code!

## üíª Making Your Changes

- **Follow the Code Style**: Please adhere to the existing code style and conventions used throughout the project. We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistency.
- **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Use a conventional commit style (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`). This helps us understand your changes at a glance.
  - Good: `feat: Implement user password reset flow`
  - Bad: `updated files`

---

## ‚úÖ Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Once your changes are ready, it's time to submit them for review.

1.  **Push Your Branch**: Push your new branch to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    # Example:
    git push origin feat/add-resource-search-bar
    ```

2.  **Create the Pull Request**: Go to your fork on GitHub. You should see a prompt to "Compare & pull request". Click it.

3.  **Write a Detailed PR Description**:

    - Clearly describe the problem you are solving and the changes you have made.
    - Link to the issue your PR is resolving (e.g., "Closes #123").
    - **Add Screenshots/Screen Recordings**: This is crucial! Visuals help reviewers understand your changes much faster. **Screen recordings are highly encouraged for UI/UX changes.**

4.  **Communicate**: Be responsive to feedback and comments on your PR. Further changes may be requested before it can be merged.

## üéØ Contribution Focus Areas

We are actively developing and refactoring certain areas. To make your contribution effective, please check our current focus areas.

### üéØ Focus Areas

We are currently focused on enhancing the user experience and visual polish of the platform. If you're looking for a place to contribute, these are our top priorities:

- üé® **UI/UX Enhancement:** We welcome creative ideas to make our UI more modern, interactive, and beautiful. If you have a good eye for design, this is your chance to shine!
- ‚ú® **Animations & Transitions:** Implementing smooth and delightful animations using `framer-motion`. This includes page transitions, component animations (like cards appearing), and interactive micro-animations.
- üß≠ **Core Component Polish:** Improving the look, feel, and functionality of key components like the Navbar, Sidebar, Footer, and the user Dashboard.
- üì± **Responsive Design:** This is a top priority! Ensuring every page and component is perfectly responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) is crucial for a great student experience.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Avoid for Now

To maintain stability and a clear roadmap, please avoid making changes in the following areas without prior discussion:

- üóÑÔ∏è **Core Database Schema:** Please **do not** make any changes to the Prisma schema, especially for the core academic structure models (`Course`, `Branch`, `Semester`, `Subject`, `Resource`). The current structure is stable and foundational to the application.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Unsolicited Backend Changes:** Please refrain from making significant backend changes unless they are tied to an existing issue that a maintainer has approved. If you have a great idea for the backend, please **first open an issue** to discuss it. We'll give you the green signal if it aligns with our roadmap.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Community and Communication

- **Be Respectful and Inclusive**: Our community is our greatest asset. Please follow our **[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** in all interactions.
- **Help Others**: If you see someone struggling with a question in an issue or discussion, feel free to help them out!

Thank you again for your interest in contributing. We can't wait to see what you build!
